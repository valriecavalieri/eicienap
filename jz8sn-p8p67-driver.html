Hello, I've been experiencing this issue for a while where Destiny 2 will crash my entire PC to a black screen and reboot.

It's strange because my PC doesn't seem to crash with any other games or benchmarks. I've run my GPU and CPU at 100% load for a few hours to stress test, but I don't crash.

Hi everyone, So my graphics card is an Nvidia 1070 from Asus and i'm having some problems while playing some games. It started a couple weeks ago when playing destiny 2, after like an hour the game freezes with the screen showing these squares and psychadelic colors. Sometimes it recovers and goes back desktop, other times it reboots. And this only happens on some games, since i play a lot of Guild Wars 2 and never had a problem. I even downloaded FurMark Rog Edition stress test and it lasted. If you can't find the driver that you need for your device, please contact us using the feedback form and we will try to find it for you.

And it was being a little loud and putting out a TON of heat. I really think it was starting to die and that it was the cause of the stuttering, especially because I tested my RAM and everything seemed to be okay with the RAM.
