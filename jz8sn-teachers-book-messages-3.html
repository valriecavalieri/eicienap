While the title is a bit silly, it raises a necessary question: after years in K-12 public school and currently being a college student, I never actually learned how to read and appreciate books and works such as 1984 or A Tale of Two Cities - only analysis of them.

My Dad died in November. He was an ER doc, a Stephen Minister, a street art/graffiti artist, a college professor, a cancer researcher, a bee keeper, and a cookbook author. He was a former US Marine, a book club leader, a community organizer, and even though he could afford a new car, drove an old 1992 5-speed Honda with 200k+ miles on it, just because he liked it.
