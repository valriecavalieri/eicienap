Hi guys, i'm trying to fix a friend's HP 15-f039wm laptop, it behaves very strangely: if the charger is plugged in, it charges the battery just fine, BUT, the processor gets stuck at 0.5GHz frequency. If i turn it on with the charger unplugged, it works just fine and even turboes (it's not a matter of temperature, because i just put fresh thermal compound in it), but as soon as I plug in the charger, it gets stuck to 0.5GHz again. I've been trying Intel HD Graphics 630 - популярная встроенная видеокарта от топового производителя, которая на сегодняний день все еще имеет большую популярность и показывает неплохие данные.

I've tried installing a few games today on it, Doom 3 (original version), Freelancer, and Age of Empires (also original version). All three installed fine however each one of them ended with various error messages that seem to point to video driver or card issues. Doom 3 - "Error initializing graphics" Freelancer - "Freelancer does not recognize your 3D video card" Age of Empires - "Make sure that your video card and driver are compatible with Direct Draw" All three produced similar result.
